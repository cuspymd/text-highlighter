Marks: Text Highlighter is a powerful, privacy-respecting Firefox extension that enables users to highlight and manage text on any web page. It is designed to boost productivity, improve reading workflows, and provide a seamless way to revisit important content while keeping your data under your control.

🔍 Key Features
✅ Multi-Color Text Highlighting
Select text on any website and highlight it with your preferred color. The extension offers five distinct highlight colors — yellow, green, blue, pink, and orange — so you can organize and categorize content visually.

⚡️ Quick Highlight via Context Menu or Shortcut
You can highlight selected text instantly using:
- A right-click context menu
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+1 through Ctrl+Shift+4, etc.)

These actions work even across multiple tabs and sessions.

🗂 Highlight Management by Page
Every highlight is stored and associated with its respective URL. Reopen any highlighted page later, and all your highlights are automatically restored. You can:

- View a list of all your highlighted pages
- Review, edit, or delete individual highlights or entire groups
- See metadata like page titles and last updated time

🧭 Minimap View for Navigation
A built-in "minimap" appears on the right edge of the page, showing markers for all your highlights. This helps you:

- Instantly locate highlighted sections on long pages
- Navigate directly to a highlight by clicking on its marker
- See which highlights are currently visible on screen

🌐 Multilingual Support
Available in both English and Korean — the UI adapts based on your browser’s language settings.

🧩 Popup Dashboard
Clicking the extension icon opens a popup with quick access to:

- Highlighted texts on the current page
- A toggle for the minimap
- Buttons to delete all highlights or export your data
- Navigation to a full-page manager for all highlights

💾 Local-First Storage & Privacy
By default, all data — including highlights, colors, and page metadata — is stored locally in your browser using the storage.local API. If you enable browser Sync, data can be synced through your browser account across devices. Marks does not run its own backend servers.
